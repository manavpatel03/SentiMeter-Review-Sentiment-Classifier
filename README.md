## Implemented Techniques

### Prefix Tuning

The repository incorporates Prefix Tuning, a novel technique introduced in recent seminal papers. This method allows for fine-tuning language models by providing task-specific prefixes during training. The implementation is tailored to optimize BERT-Small, enhancing its adaptability to various NLP tasks.

### Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)

We have successfully integrated Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the repository, based on state-of-the-art research. This technique involves adapting models like BERT to low-rank structures, improving efficiency without compromising performance. Our implementation of LoRA is designed to refine the capabilities of the larger BERT model.
